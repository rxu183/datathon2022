## Inspiration
We were inspired to go with this heat map because of our desire to consolidate more metrics than the ones we were initially given in order to better consider the many factors that go into a decision as complex as determining where to invest in another medical facility.
## What it does
We used Pandas, Juypter, and 
## How we built it
We ran
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges over the course of conducting this Datathon - notably syntax with Pandas and developing an accurate and comprehensive metric to rate each of the states by. The relative importances assigned to the factors we considered - e.g. population growth, number of pre-existing certified centers, etc, were particularly difficult to develop and scale properly.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of how much we've learned over the course of this Datathon. WE also were proud of how versatile we were in coming up with functional datasetws 
## What we learned
we learned a lot about using Juypter and Pandas and manipulating datasets. Learning how to use various tools to visualize the data within a choropleth given geojson shape data also made for a very entertaining and useful learning experience. 
## What's next for Improving Early Detection in Every Direction: Mammograms.
There are a number of
